## About:

After seeing the data website for the State, I thought that there was a better way to visualize the information to the public. The data throughout this website is gathered daily from the State of Rhode Island Department of Health COVID-19 data. In addition, I use the Rhode Island City & Town Population Estimates from July 1, 2018, to derive some of the estimates throughout this website, such as the number of cases per resident. If you are intrested in viewing the original datasets, feel free to visit my [github](https://github.com/jjenki22/Rhode-Island-COVID-19-/tree/master/Data "github.com") page. 

## About me: 

I am currently a graduate student at the University of Notre Dame, pursuing a Master's of Science in Business Analytics. Before attending the University of Notre Dame, I graduated as a dual major in Economics and Political Science from the University of Rochester.
