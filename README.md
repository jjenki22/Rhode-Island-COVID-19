# Rhode-Island-COVID-19

The code contained in this repository is the code behind the website [ricoronainfo.org](http://ricoronainfo.org/). I created a shiny app to view the COVID-19 cases in Rhode Island. The data files will be updated regularly to reflect the current state of affairs in Rhode Island.
